                <p>The problem of plastic pollution is growing exponentially every year; we are producing more than 300 million tons of plastic, half of this is designed for single use, and each year around 8 million tons of it ends up in our oceans. We can solve this problem and we can do it by educating and engaging everyone in a conversation to rethink plastic. Plastic Oceans is working to change the way we deal with plastic waste by challenging society’s perception that this indestructible substance can be treated as ‘disposable’.
                </p>
                <p>Plastic Oceans International  engages people of all ages, in all social situations, to understand the danger of continuing to perceive plastic to be disposable. Once they become aware of the ultimate threat to human health, it will become a personal choice to prevent plastic waste from entering the environment. We have tackled this issue, through an awareness campaign using film and media reaching millions of people around the world. We will continue to spread the message of the positive solutions we can apply to stop the negative impact of plastic using film and supportive activatism to engage students through education, industries through entrepreneurship and partnering with global organizations actively changing their communities.</p>

                            Plastic Oceans internional helps educate and empower citizens to take action on behalf of the ocean. From the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico to the halls of Congress, Ocean Conservancy brings people together to help find solutions for our planet. In fact, for nearly three decades, International Coastal Cleanup (the Cleanup) has mobilized millions of people to participate in the world's largest volunteer effort to help clean our oceans and waterways.<br/>
                            Since 1995, The Coca-Cola Company has sponsored the Cleanup and Ocean Conservancy through educational outreach, community engagement, research, industry collaborations, marketing and more. Coca-Cola volunteers play an active role in the annual Cleanup. Last year, more than 24,000 Coca-Cola associates, family and friends rolled up their sleeves and helped clean 1,300 miles of coastline in 27 countries.
